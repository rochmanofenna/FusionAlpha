## **GAP CLOSURE ANALYSIS:**

### **BEFORE - Resume Claims vs Reality:**
```
RESUME CLAIM: "Extensive experience with RHEL system administration"
REALITY: No systemd services, no configuration management

RESUME CLAIM: "Infrastructure as Code with Terraform"  
REALITY: No terraform modules or cloud infrastructure

RESUME CLAIM: "Configuration management with Ansible"
REALITY: No ansible playbooks or automation

RESUME CLAIM: "Monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana"
REALITY: No monitoring configurations or alerting rules

RESUME CLAIM: "GPU cluster management and optimization"
REALITY: No infrastructure supporting GPU workloads
```

### **AFTER - Evidence Now Available:**
