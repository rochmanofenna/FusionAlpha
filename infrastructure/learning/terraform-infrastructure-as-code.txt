TERRAFORM - INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE (IAC)

WHAT IS TERRAFORM?
==================
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision 
cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files. Created by HashiCorp, it supports 
multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) and on-premises solutions.

KEY CONCEPTS:
=============

1. DECLARATIVE CONFIGURATION:
   - Describe WHAT you want, not HOW to create it
   - Terraform figures out the steps to achieve desired state
   - Configuration written in HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)

2. STATE MANAGEMENT:
   - Terraform keeps track of resources in state files (.tfstate)
   - Maps real resources to configuration
   - Enables planning, updating, and destroying infrastructure

3. PROVIDERS:
   - Plugins that interact with APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
   - Each provider has resources and data sources
   - Example: aws_instance, google_compute_instance

4. RESOURCES:
   - Infrastructure components (EC2 instances, VPCs, databases)
   - Defined with resource blocks: resource "aws_instance" "example"

5. DATA SOURCES:
   - Read-only information from existing infrastructure
   - Example: data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" (find latest Ubuntu AMI)

TERRAFORM WORKFLOW:
==================

1. WRITE - Create .tf configuration files
2. PLAN - terraform plan (preview changes)
3. APPLY - terraform apply (execute changes)
4. DESTROY - terraform destroy (tear down infrastructure)

REAL-WORLD GPU CLUSTER BREAKDOWN:
=================================

VPC AND NETWORKING:
- aws_vpc: Isolated network environment
- aws_subnet: Network segments across availability zones
- aws_internet_gateway: Internet access
- aws_route_table: Traffic routing rules
- aws_security_group: Firewall rules

COMPUTE RESOURCES:
- aws_launch_template: Instance configuration template
- aws_autoscaling_group: Automatic scaling based on demand
- Instance types: p3.2xlarge (1 V100), p3.8xlarge (4 V100s)
- GPU-optimized AMIs with NVIDIA drivers

STORAGE:
- EBS volumes: High-performance SSD storage
- gp3 volumes: 3,000 IOPS baseline, burstable to 16,000
- Encrypted at rest for security
- Separate data volumes for datasets/checkpoints

SECURITY FEATURES:
- VPC isolation from internet
- Security groups as virtual firewalls
- IAM roles for service permissions
- Encrypted storage and data in transit
- SSH key-based authentication only

MONITORING AND LOGGING:
- CloudWatch integration for metrics
- Custom log groups for application logs
- GPU utilization monitoring
- Cost tracking and alerts

HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:
==================================

1. MULTI-AZ DEPLOYMENT:
   - Spreads instances across availability zones
   - Increases fault tolerance
   - Better resource availability

2. AUTO SCALING:
   - Automatic scaling based on workload
   - Cost optimization (scale down when not needed)
   - Handle varying compute demands

3. SPOT INSTANCES (OPTIONAL):
   - Up to 90% cost savings
   - Good for fault-tolerant ML training
   - Can be interrupted by AWS

4. EBS OPTIMIZATION:
   - gp3 volumes for cost-effective performance
   - Separate data volumes for persistence
   - Automatic snapshots for backups

FINANCIAL/TRADING SYSTEM APPLICATIONS:
=====================================

1. HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING:
   - GPU acceleration for real-time analytics
   - Low-latency networking (SR-IOV, Enhanced Networking)
   - Co-location in specific AWS regions

2. RISK MANAGEMENT:
   - Monte Carlo simulations on GPU clusters
   - Parallel processing of risk scenarios
   - Real-time portfolio analysis

3. MACHINE LEARNING MODELS:
   - Training trading algorithms
   - Feature engineering pipelines
   - Model backtesting infrastructure

4. MARKET DATA PROCESSING:
   - Real-time tick data processing
   - Pattern recognition at scale
   - Sentiment analysis from news/social media

COST OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:
============================

1. INSTANCE SCHEDULING:
   - Auto-shutdown during non-trading hours
   - Use smaller instances for development
   - Reserved instances for predictable workloads

2. STORAGE OPTIMIZATION:
   - S3 for long-term data archival
   - EBS snapshots for point-in-time backups
   - Data lifecycle policies

3. MONITORING:
   - CloudWatch billing alarms
   - Resource utilization tracking
   - Automated cost reporting

SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
=======================

1. NETWORK SECURITY:
   - VPC with private subnets
   - NAT gateways for outbound internet
   - Network ACLs as secondary firewall layer

2. ACCESS CONTROL:
   - IAM roles instead of access keys
   - Principle of least privilege
   - MFA for administrative access

3. DATA PROTECTION:
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Regular security patching
   - Vulnerability scanning

TERRAFORM ADVANTAGES:
====================

1. VERSION CONTROL:
   - Infrastructure changes tracked in Git
   - Code review process for infrastructure
   - Rollback capabilities

2. CONSISTENCY:
   - Identical environments (dev/staging/prod)
   - No configuration drift
   - Repeatable deployments

3. DOCUMENTATION:
   - Infrastructure self-documented in code
   - Dependencies clearly defined
   - Change history preserved

4. MULTI-CLOUD:
   - Same tool works across cloud providers
   - Avoid vendor lock-in
   - Hybrid cloud strategies

COMMON TERRAFORM COMMANDS:
=========================
terraform init          # Initialize working directory
terraform plan          # Create execution plan
terraform apply         # Apply configuration changes
terraform destroy       # Destroy managed infrastructure
terraform fmt           # Format configuration files
terraform validate      # Validate configuration syntax
terraform state list    # List resources in state
terraform state show    # Show resource details
terraform import        # Import existing infrastructure
terraform workspace    # Manage multiple environments

PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS:
=========================

1. STATE MANAGEMENT:
   - Remote state storage (S3 + DynamoDB)
   - State locking to prevent conflicts
   - State file encryption

2. MODULARIZATION:
   - Reusable modules for common patterns
   - Version pinning for stability
   - Input validation with variables

3. CI/CD INTEGRATION:
   - Automated testing of infrastructure
   - Gradual rollouts with blue/green deployments
   - Integration with monitoring systems
