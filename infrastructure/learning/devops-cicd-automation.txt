DEVOPS AND CI/CD AUTOMATION - MODERN SOFTWARE DELIVERY

WHAT IS DEVOPS?
===============
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) 
to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
It emphasizes automation, monitoring, and collaboration between development and operations teams.

WHAT IS CI/CD?
==============
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery:

- CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION (CI): Automatically test and build code changes
- CONTINUOUS DELIVERY (CD): Automatically deploy to staging environments  
- CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT (CD): Automatically deploy to production

KEY CONCEPTS:
=============

1. CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION:
   - Developers integrate code changes frequently (multiple times daily)
   - Automated builds and tests run on every commit
   - Early detection of integration issues
   - Shared repository with version control (Git)

2. CONTINUOUS DELIVERY:
   - Extension of CI that automatically deploys to staging
   - Manual approval gate before production deployment
   - Ensures software is always in deployable state
   - Reduces deployment risk through automation

3. CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT:
   - Full automation including production deployment
   - No manual intervention required
   - Requires high confidence in automated testing
   - Enables rapid feature delivery

4. INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE (IAC):
   - Infrastructure defined in code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
   - Version controlled and repeatable
   - Consistent environments across dev/staging/prod
   - Automated provisioning and configuration
