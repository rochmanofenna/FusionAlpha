ANSIBLE - CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT AND AUTOMATION

WHAT IS ANSIBLE?
================
Ansible is an open-source automation tool for configuration management, application deployment,
and IT orchestration. Created by Red Hat, it uses SSH and is agentless (no software to install
on managed nodes). Uses YAML for playbooks, making it human-readable and easy to learn.

KEY CONCEPTS:
=============

1. INVENTORY:
   - Defines hosts and groups of hosts
   - Can be static (YAML/INI files) or dynamic (scripts, cloud providers)
   - Groups allow bulk operations and variable sharing
   - Host variables and group variables for customization

2. PLAYBOOKS:
   - YAML files that define automation tasks
   - Declarative - describe desired state, not steps
   - Idempotent - safe to run multiple times
   - Can include multiple plays for different host groups

3. MODULES:
   - Units of work that Ansible executes
   - Examples: file, copy, yum, service, user, mysql_user
   - Over 3,000+ modules available
   - Custom modules can be written in any language

4. TASKS:
   - Individual actions using modules
   - Run in order within a play
   - Can be conditional, looped, or delegated

5. HANDLERS:
   - Special tasks that run when notified
   - Used for service restarts, config reloads
   - Run at the end of a play, even if notified multiple times

REAL-WORLD GPU CLUSTER BREAKDOWN:
=================================

SYSTEM PREPARATION:

- Version pinning for reproducible environments

SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION:
- CPU governor settings for performance

ANSIBLE ADVANTAGES:
==================

1. AGENTLESS:
   - No software to install on managed nodes
   - Uses SSH (already present on Linux systems)
   - Reduced attack surface and maintenance

2. IDEMPOTENT:
   - Safe to run playbooks multiple times
   - Only makes necessary changes
   - Predictable and consistent results

3. DECLARATIVE:
   - Describe desired end state
   - Ansible figures out how to achieve it
   - Self-documenting infrastructure

4. SCALABLE:
   - Manages 1 to 10,000+ nodes
   - Parallel execution across hosts
   - Rolling updates and zero-downtime deployments

5. EXTENSIBLE:
   - Custom modules and plugins
   - Integration with cloud providers
   - Dynamic inventory from external sources

FINANCIAL/TRADING APPLICATIONS:
==============================

1. COMPLIANCE AND AUDITING:
   - Consistent configuration across environments
   - Change tracking and documentation
   - Security baseline enforcement
   - Automated compliance reporting

2. DISASTER RECOVERY:
   - Rapid environment reconstruction
   - Automated failover procedures
   - Configuration backup and restore
   - Cross-region deployment consistency

3. HIGH-PERFORMANCE TRADING:
   - Kernel parameter tuning for low latency
   - Network optimization for market data
   - CPU pinning and NUMA optimization
   - Real-time system configuration

4. RISK MANAGEMENT:
   - Automated security patching
   - Configuration drift detection
   - Environment isolation and controls
   - Audit trail for all changes

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT:
====================

STATIC INVENTORY (YAML):
- Human-readable and version-controlled
- Hierarchical grouping of hosts
- Variable inheritance from groups
- Environment-specific configurations

DYNAMIC INVENTORY:
- Cloud provider integration (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Auto-discovery of instances
- Tag-based grouping
- Real-time infrastructure updates

HOST VARIABLES:
- Per-host customization
- Hardware-specific settings
- Role-based configurations
- Override group variables

GROUP VARIABLES:
- Shared settings across host groups
- Environment-specific values
- Role-based defaults
- Hierarchical inheritance

ANSIBLE BEST PRACTICES:
======================

1. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
```
project/
├── inventories/
│   ├── production/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── development/
├── group_vars/
├── host_vars/
├── roles/
├── playbooks/
└── requirements.yml
```

2. ROLE-BASED ORGANIZATION:
- Reusable components
- Clear responsibilities
- Version control and sharing
- Dependency management

3. VARIABLE PRECEDENCE:
- Command line > Play vars > Host vars > Group vars > Role vars
- Understanding precedence prevents conflicts
- Use group_vars and host_vars for organization

4. SECURITY:
- Ansible Vault for sensitive data
- SSH key management
- Privilege escalation controls
- Secure credential handling

COMMON ANSIBLE COMMANDS:
=======================
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -i inventory         # Run playbook
ansible all -m ping -i inventory                   # Test connectivity
ansible-vault create secrets.yml                   # Create encrypted file
ansible-vault edit secrets.yml                     # Edit encrypted file
