# FusionAlpha: Market Contradiction Detection Trading System

## Overview

FusionAlpha is an advanced algorithmic trading system that exploits market inefficiencies by detecting contradictions between news sentiment and actual price movements. The system combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and stochastic processes to identify and trade on market mispricings.

## Core Theory: Contradiction-Based Alpha Generation

### The Hypothesis

Markets often exhibit temporary inefficiencies where:
1. **Overhype**: Positive news sentiment contradicts negative price movement
2. **Underhype**: Negative news sentiment contradicts positive price movement

These contradictions represent opportunities where market sentiment hasn't yet aligned with price action, creating predictable mean-reversion or momentum patterns.

### Technical Implementation

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Contradiction Detection Engine**
   - Analyzes news sentiment using FinBERT (financial-domain BERT)
   - Compares sentiment scores with technical indicators and price movements
   - Uses adaptive thresholds to identify statistically significant contradictions

2. **Event Neural Network (ENN)**
   - Processes temporal sequences of market events
   - Maintains dynamic memory of market states
   - Provides context-aware predictions based on historical patterns

3. **BICEP (Brownian Integrated Contradiction Event Processor)**
   - Models price movements using stochastic differential equations
   - Simulates potential price paths using GPU-accelerated Brownian motion
   - Optimizes entry/exit points based on probabilistic outcomes
